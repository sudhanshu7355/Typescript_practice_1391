 This repository is a collection of my practice and exploration of fundamental TypeScript concepts including
 strings, numbers, functions, classes, interfaces, arrays, and the any type.
 Each topic is accompanied by examples and hands-on exercises that I've worked on to solidify my understanding of TypeScript.
 This project serves as a reference for anyone looking to learn or revisit these core concepts.
